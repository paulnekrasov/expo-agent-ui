# REVIEW REPORT
Reviewer session date: 2026-04-27
Roadmap Phase: Phase 0 - Repo Reset And Cleanup
Product Stage: Stage 0 - Cleanup
Task status: passed with noted limitations

## Findings

No blocking findings for the cleanup pass.

## Verified

- Old parser, resolver, VS Code extension, tree-sitter, WASM, Canvas renderer, old tests, and old
  prompt-template surfaces were removed from active context.
- Old root-level SwiftUI preview research and planning markdown files under `docs/` were removed
  after their useful ideas were compressed into the new reference docs.
- New compact reference docs preserve reusable design ideas without reviving old implementation
  contracts.
- Repo-local agent definitions now route to Expo Agent UI product stages instead of parser stages.
- `docs/reference/INDEX.md` no longer points agents to old layer-based references.
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `PHASE_STATE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and runtime prompt status describe the
  cleanup as complete.

## Verification Commands

- `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present`
- `npm run build --workspaces --if-present`
- `npm test --workspaces --if-present`

## Limitations And Follow-Ups

- Remote old branches under `origin/dev/*` were not deleted.
- npm still reports moderate audit findings from the dependency graph; remediation is a separate
  dependency task.
- Stage 2 component primitives remain the active next implementation task.
